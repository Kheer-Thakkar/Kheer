<h1>Project on Console</h1>
<p>Visual studio is higer level app than brackets. First when people used coding they found that brackets is not so good app for them but visual stuido is much better.
    console screen and visual studio now these are two different screens i will call visual studio to main screen to reduce confusion. So main screen works like a main screen only and console screen works like rough page. 
    For example: if we are writing a math paper we need a rough page to slove sums right if we will slove sums on the paper it will look untidy so we will use a rough paper so the rough paper is called console screen. Now the main screen which is visual studio this works like a main paper like when in rough paper
we slove sums our final answer we will write in the answersheet right so that is our main paper where we write the final work.
